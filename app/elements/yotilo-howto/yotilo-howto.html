                How to use Yotilo
            </h1>

            <hr />


            <p>
                This guide describes how to use Yotilo. I wrote a description for each function. If there is missing something, I would be pleased if you contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamiski/">twitter</a> or per <a href="Benjamin.Kowalski.1987@gmail.com">email</a>.
            </p> 


            <h1>
                1. Managing time entries
            </h1>


            <h2 id="adding-time">
                1.1 Adding a time entry
            </h2>
            <p>
                You can add a time entry by clicking on the button titled <em>ADD ENTRY</em> on the right side of each date. If you want to add an entry to a date which is not displayed, go to XX and read about how to display different dates.
            </p>

            <h2>
                1.2 Starting a stopwatch and editing durations
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once you created a time entry, the duration is on the left. If you hover it, there is a button with a play icon. Click it and a timer is set for this entry. By clicking on the duration itself, you can edit the duration manually. The format of each duration is HOURS:MINUTES.
            </p>

            <h2>
                1.3 Editing the project and task of an time entry
            </h2>
            <p>
                The project is right to the duration. Click on it and you will see a list of projects. Click on one to select the project for the time entry. The task is displayed right to the project. Please read XX to get information about how to add a project or task to that list.
            </p>

            <h2>
                1.4 Adding a comment to a time entry
            </h2>
            <p>
                Each time entry has a field for a comment. After creating a new time entry, you will see a button in it named <em>No comment</em>. Click on it to edit the comment.
            </p>

            <h2>
                1.5 Deleting an time entry
            </h2>
            <p> 
                If you hover a time entry, you will see a button on the right with an X on it. Click it to delete the time entry.
            </p>


            <h1>
                2. Managing projects and tasks
            </h1>
            <p>
                Managing projects and tasks has both the same functions. That's why I will describe every function with the example of projects.
            </p>

            <h2>
                2.1 Adding a project or task
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the header on the right, you see two links. <em>Projects</em> and <em>Tasks</em>. Click on projects. An overlay will open. Click on <em>ADD ENTRY</em> to add a project.
            </p>

            <h2>
                2.2 Renaming a project or task
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once you created a project, you can click on the field titled <em>No Name</em> to edit the name of the project. The name title of the project is saved directly.
            </p>

            <h2>
                2.3 Deleting a project or task
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you hover a project in the overlay with your mouse, you will see a button titled <em>ARCHIVE ENTRY</em>. Click on it to put it into the archive. The project is not deleted completely, but you won't see entries with this project in you overview. You can't choose an archived project for an entry, too.<br /><br />

                If you're shure to delete the entry completely, go to the archive by clicking <em>ARCHIVED PROJECTS</em> in the overlay. Now you see all of the archived projects. If you hover an entry, you'll see two buttons. If you click <em>DELETE</em>, you project will be removed permanently with all connected time entries.
            </p>

            <h1>
                3. Filter time entries
            </h1>
            <p>
                You can filter you time entries to get better statistics and a better overview for single projects and tasks.
            </p>

            <h2>
                3.2 Filter projects and tasks
            </h2>
            <p> 
                To filter you time entries for specific projects or tasks, click on one of of the two filters in the header on the left. A dropdown will open. In the beginning, all projects (or tasks) are selected. Click on some of them to toggle the select-status of them. If there is no check icon in the checkbox, no time entry with this project is shown in the overview. The statistic on top of the app will show data concerning the selected projects and tasks.
            </p>
            <h2>
                3.3 Filter for a specific period of time
            </h2>
            <p>
                You may want to see a statistic for a specific period of time. Let's say you want to get statistics for the current week. Go to the third filter in the header of the app which is titled <em>PERIOD OF TIME</em>. A dropdown with two month will open. Select the start date on the left by clicking a day. Select the end date by clicking a day on the right. For you examply, select the sunday on the left and the saturyday of the same week on the right. You will see, that the period of time will change. The overview will display all days between the start- and the end-date. The statistics will summarize only data from these day.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                That's it. Now, you know how to manage time entries, projects and tasks. You can filter the time entries for projects, tasks and a specific period of time. I hope you enjoy using Yotilo.
