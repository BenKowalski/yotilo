                How to use Yotilo
            </h1>

            <hr />


            <p>
                This guide describes how to use Yotilo. I wrote a description for each function. If there is missing something, I would be pleased if you contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamiski/" target="_blank">twitter</a> or per <a href="mailto:Benjamin.Kowalski.1987@gmail.com">email</a>.
            </p> 


            <h1>
                1. Managing time entries
            </h1>


            <h2 id="adding-time">
                1.1 Adding a time entry
            </h2>
            <p>
                You can add a time entry by clicking on the button titled <em>ADD ENTRY</em> on the right side of each date. If you want to add an entry to a date which is not displayed, read 3.3 about how to display different dates.
            </p>

            <h2>
                1.2 Starting a stopwatch and editing durations
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once you created a time entry the duration is on the left. If you hover the duration you will see a button with a play icon. Click the button and a timer is set for this entry. By clicking on the duration itself you can edit the duration manually. The format of each duration is HOURS:MINUTES.
            </p>

            <h2>
                1.3 Editing the project and task of a time entry
            </h2>
            <p>
                The project is right to the duration. Click on it and you will see a list of all active projects. Click on one project to select it for the time entry. The task is displayed right to the project. Please read 2.1 to get information about how to add a project or task to that list.
            </p>

            <h2>
                1.4 Adding a comment to a time entry
            </h2>
            <p>
                Each time entry has a field for a comment. After creating a new time entry, you will see a button named <em>No comment</em>. Click on it to edit the comment. Comments are just for you. You can't use a filter on them.
            </p>

            <h2>
                1.5 Deleting an time entry
            </h2>
            <p> 
                If you hover a time entry you will see a button on the right with an X on it. Click it to delete the time entry.
            </p>


            <h1>
                2. Managing projects and tasks
            </h1>
            <p>
                Managing projects and tasks is identical. That's why I will describe every function for projects.
            </p>

            <h2>
                2.1 Adding a project or task
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the header on the right are two links: <em>Projects</em> and <em>Tasks</em>. Click on projects. An overlay will open. Click on <em>ADD ENTRY</em> to add a project.
            </p>

            <h2>
                2.2 Renaming a project or task
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once you created a project, you can click on the field titled <em>No Name</em> to edit the title of the project. The title of the project is saved directly.
            </p>

            <h2>
                2.3 Deleting a project or task
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you hover a project in the overlay with your mouse you will see a button titled <em>ARCHIVE ENTRY</em>. Click on it to put it into the archive. The project is not deleted completely, but you won't see entries connected to this project in your overview. You can't choose an archived project for an entry, either.<br /><br />

                If you're sure to delete the entry completely, go to the archive by clicking <em>ARCHIVED PROJECTS</em> in the overlay header. There is a list of all of all archived projects. If you hover an entry, you'll see two buttons. If you click <em>DELETE</em>, your project will be removed permanently with all connected time entries.
            </p>

            <h1>
                3. Filter time entries
            </h1>
            <p>
                You can filter your time entries to get more accurat statistics and a better overview for single projects and tasks.
            </p>

            <h2>
                3.2 Filter projects and tasks
            </h2>
            <p> 
                To filter your time entries for specific projects or tasks click on one of the two filters in the header on the left. A dropdown will open. In the beginning all projects (or tasks) are selected. Click on some of them to toggle the select-status of them. If there is no check icon in the checkbox, no time entry connected to this project is shown in the overview. The statistic on top of the app will show data concerning only the selected projects and tasks.
            </p>
            <h2>
                3.3 Filter for a specific period of time
            </h2>
            <p>
                You may want to get a statistic for a specific period of time. Let's say you want to get statistics for the current week. Go to the third filter in the header of the app which is titled <em>PERIOD OF TIME</em>. A dropdown with two month will open. Select the start-date on the left by clicking a day. Select the end-date by clicking a day on the right. For our example, select the sunday on the left and the saturday of the same week on the right. You will see that the period of time will change. The overview will display all days between the start- and the end-date. The statistics will only summarize data from these day.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <p>
                That's it. You know how to manage time entries, projects and tasks. You can filter the time entries for projects, tasks and a specific period of time. I hope you enjoy using Yotilo.
